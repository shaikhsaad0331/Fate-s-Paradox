#### **1. Game Title:**
**The Time Traveler's Dilemma**

#### **2. Description:**
"The Time Traveler's Dilemma" is an AI-powered text-based adventure game where players take on the role of a time traveler with the ability to communicate with their past selves. Players must make decisions that affect the timeline and humanity’s fate, with each choice having far-reaching consequences, emphasizing the butterfly effect. The game adapts dynamically to player choices, allowing multiple story outcomes and high replayability.

#### **3. Key Features:**
- **Branching Storyline:** Five significant decision points, each with multiple outcomes.
- **AI-Driven Dynamic Story Generation:** AI generates dialogue, plot twists, and events based on player decisions.
- **Adaptive NPC Responses:** Characters respond based on past interactions and current game states.
- **Butterfly Effect Mechanic:** Small changes to the timeline cause large-scale consequences, altering the story.
- **Time Travel Mechanics:** Players can interact with their past selves, affecting future events.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Allows intuitive and fluid player interactions using simple text inputs.

#### **4. Technical Specifications:**
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
- **NLP Library:** NLTK or spaCy
- **Machine Learning Library:** TensorFlow or PyTorch
- **Game Engine:** Custom-built engine using Python and text-based input/output
- **User Interface:** Retro-inspired ASCII art and clear, intuitive text-based command system
- **AI-Generated Music:** The soundtrack adapts to the player’s actions, creating an immersive experience
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Adjusts based on player performance for an optimized challenge.

#### **5. Game Mechanics:**
1. **Branching Storyline:**
   - Uses a story graph data structure with nodes (events/scenes) and edges (player choices) to manage branching paths.
   - Multiple endings based on decisions made at critical points.
2. **AI-Driven Story Generation:**
   - Machine learning algorithms dynamically generate unique story content each playthrough.
3. **Time Travel:**
   - Players can revisit previous points in time, altering the present/future outcomes.
   - Interactions with past selves introduce paradoxes that influence the plot.
4. **Butterfly Effect System:**
   - Minor decisions at one point in time can lead to drastic changes in the timeline, such as new characters, altered environments, or different story arcs.

#### **6. Setup Instructions:**
- **Dependencies:**
  - Python 3.x
  - NLTK (for Natural Language Processing)
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch (for machine learning)
  - ASCII art libraries (optional for UI design)
- **Installation:**
  1. Clone the repository from GitHub (or download the provided zip file).
  2. Install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  3. Run `main.py` to start the game.
- **Usage:**
